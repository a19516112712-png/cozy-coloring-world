            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-cocoa mt-10 mb-4">Welcome to Our Collection</h2>
            <p className="text-cocoa/75 leading-relaxed mb-4">Welcome to the ultimate resource for printable coloring pages! Whether you are a parent looking for screen-free activities, a teacher building classroom resources, or an adult seeking relaxing creative time, this guide covers everything you need to know. We share our complete collection of 180+ free printable coloring pages along with expert tips for getting the best prints every time.</p>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-cocoa mt-10 mb-4">Why These Pages Are So Popular</h2>
            <p className="text-cocoa/75 leading-relaxed mb-4">Printable coloring pages have become one of the most popular free resources online, and for good reason. They are instantly accessible (download and print in seconds), endlessly reusable (print as many copies as you want), and require no special equipment beyond a printer and basic coloring supplies. Unlike physical coloring books, printable pages let you curate your own collection, mixing and matching from different themes and difficulty levels.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-cocoa mt-10 mb-4">How to Get Beautiful Coloring Results</h2>
            <p className="text-cocoa/75 leading-relaxed mb-4">Getting professional-quality prints is easier than you think. Start with a good printer: any modern inkjet or laser printer works great. For the paper, standard 20lb printer paper is fine for crayons and colored pencils. Upgrade to 80lb cardstock for markers, gel pens, or watercolors. Always select High Quality or Best in your printer settings. For the sharpest lines, print in black and white or grayscale mode.</p>
            <p className="text-cocoa/75 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              For all our coloring pages, we recommend starting with good quality materials. Prismacolor or Faber-Castell colored pencils offer rich pigment and smooth blending. For markers, Ohuhu or Copic alcohol markers deliver vibrant, streak-free results. Gel pens add beautiful metallic and glitter accents. And for the youngest artists, classic Crayola crayons on standard printer paper work perfectly.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-cocoa mt-10 mb-4">Tips for the Best Coloring Experience</h2>
            <p className="text-cocoa/75 leading-relaxed mb-4">Build a coloring binder! Print your favorite pages, three-hole punch them, and store in a binder with plastic sleeves. This creates a personalized coloring book you can add to anytime. For classrooms, print bulk copies of the same design for group activities. Laminate finished pages to use as placemats or wall art. The possibilities are endless when every page is free to print.</p>
            <p className="text-cocoa/75 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Remember that coloring is about the journey, not just the destination. Put on some calming music, make a cup of tea, and allow yourself to get lost in the creative process. There are no mistakes in coloring, only happy accidents that make your page uniquely yours.
